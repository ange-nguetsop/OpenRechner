# C++ Calculator Application

## Overview
This C++ console application serves as a versatile calculator capable of handling basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, as well as more complex calculations involving complex numbers and fractions.

## Features
- **Basic Arithmetic**: Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Complex Number Calculations**: Handle arithmetic operations with complex numbers.
- **Fraction Calculations**: Perform calculations with fractions, simplifying results where applicable.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the source code using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++, clang).
3. Run the compiled executable.

## Usage
- Launch the application from the command line.
- Select the type of calculation (basic, complex number, fraction).
- Enter the numbers as prompted.
- The application will display the result.

## Examples
1. Basic Arithmetic: `5 + 3` results in `8`.
2. Complex Number: `(1 + 2i) * (3 + 4i)` results in `-5 + 10i`.
3. Fraction: `Frac(2.5)` results in `5/2`
